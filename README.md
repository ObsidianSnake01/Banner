# Banner

This script is intended for educational purposes only and is not a complete or robust solution for displaying banners in shell scripts. It is only meant to illustrate one way that a banner can be displayed in a script. There are many other ways to achieve this effect, and a real-world script would likely include additional features and error handling.
